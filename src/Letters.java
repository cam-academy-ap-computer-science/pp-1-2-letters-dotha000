It's a sport\nthat requires lots of skill and is really fun. Last of\nall I really like eating food! Of course anyone likes\nfood but I have an addiction to it.");

So far it hasn't been\nto difficult but maybe soon it will get more challenging.\nAnother one of my class is AP biology. I'm really\nexcited about this class because we get to learn about\nlife and disecting animals. Lastly I have honors pre-calculus.\nIt's nothing too hard yet but it's still a subject I enjoy.");
